        <h1> Erin Lloyd's Biography</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Erin Lloyd, and I am currently a sophomore at Syracuse University’s School of Information Studies pursuing a degree in Applied Data Analytics. Within my major, I am curious to do work in many industries, and find out which is best suited to my interests, but right now I am most interested in healthcare analytics.

        <p>
            In my time at Syracuse University, I have been awarded the Leadership Scholarship, which grants me half-off of tuition, as well as I have been on the Dean’s List every semester that I have studied here. Additionally, I earned the Invest in Success Scholarship, which is given to any first-year student that earns a 3.7 or higher during their first semester.

        <h2> Personal Info </h2>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I am interested in reading many genres of books, and I enjoy working out, specifically outside. I love spending time with my friends, my two siblings and my mother. Lastly, I enjoy doing puzzles of all sorts, whether it is 2048, <strong> sudoku</strong>, or a literal puzzle, it always seems to ease my stress and distract me momentarily.
